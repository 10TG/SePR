    net: amend the fix for SO_BSDCOMPAT gsopt infoleak
    
    The fix for CVE-2009-0676 (upstream commit df0bca04) is incomplete. Note
    that the same problem of leaking kernel memory will reappear if someone
    on some architecture uses struct timeval with some internal padding (for
    example tv_sec 64-bit and tv_usec 32-bit) --- then, you are going to
    leak the padded bytes to userspace.
