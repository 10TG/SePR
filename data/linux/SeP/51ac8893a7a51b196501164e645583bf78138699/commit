    xen-pciback: rate limit error messages from xen_pcibk_enable_msi{,x}()
    
    ... as being guest triggerable (e.g. by invoking
    XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi{,x} on a device not being MSI/MSI-X capable).
    
    This is CVE-2013-0231 / XSA-43.
    
    Also make the two messages uniform in both their wording and severity.
