    x86/kvm: Cache gfn to pfn translation
    
    __kvm_map_gfn()'s call to gfn_to_pfn_memslot() is
    * relatively expensive
    * in certain cases (such as when done from atomic context) cannot be called
    
    Stashing gfn-to-pfn mapping should help with both cases.
    
    This is part of CVE-2019-3016.
