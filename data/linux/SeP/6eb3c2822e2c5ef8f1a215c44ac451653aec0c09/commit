    ====================
    Please consider pulling this batch of fixes for the 3.13 stream...
    
    For the mac80211 bits, Johannes says:
    
    "Here's a fix for another potential radiotap parser buffer overrun thanks
    to Evan Huus, and a fix for a cfg80211 warning in a certain corner case
    (reconnecting to the same BSS)."
    
    For the bluetooth bits, Gustavo says:
    
    "Two patches in this pull request. An important fix from Marcel in the
    permission check for HCI User Channels, there was a extra check for
    CAP_NET_RAW, and it was now removed. These channels should only require
    CAP_NET_ADMIN. The other patch is a device id addition."
    
    On top of that...
    
    Sujith Manoharan provides a workaround for a hardware problem that
    can result in lost interrupts.
    
    Larry Finger fixes an oops when unloading the rtlwifi driver (Red
    Hat bug 852761).
    
    Mathy Vanhoef fixes a somewhat minor MAC address privacy issue
    (CVE-2013-4579).
