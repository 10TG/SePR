    Fix sctp privilege elevation (CVE-2006-3745)
    
    sctp_make_abort_user() now takes the msg_len along with the msg
    so that we don't have to recalculate the bytes in iovec.
    It also uses memcpy_fromiovec() so that we don't go beyond the
    length allocated.
    
    It is good to have this fix even if verify_iovec() is fixed to
    return error on overflow.
