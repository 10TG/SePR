    Pull KVM fixes from Radim Krčmář:
     "ARM:
       - A number of issues in the vgic discovered using SMATCH
       - A bit one-off calculation in out stage base address mask (32-bit
         and 64-bit)
       - Fixes to single-step debugging instructions that trap for other
         reasons such as MMMIO aborts
       - Printing unavailable hyp mode as error
       - Potential spinlock deadlock in the vgic
       - Avoid calling vgic vcpu free more than once
       - Broken bit calculation for big endian systems
    
     s390:
       - SPDX tags
       - Fence storage key accesses from problem state
       - Make sure that irq_state.flags is not used in the future
    
      x86:
       - Intercept port 0x80 accesses to prevent host instability (CVE)
       - Use userspace FPU context for guest FPU (mainly an optimization
         that fixes a double use of kernel FPU)
       - Do not leak one page per module load
       - Flush APIC page address cache from MMU invalidation notifiers"
