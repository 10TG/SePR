    ext4: add corruption check in ext4_xattr_set_entry()
    
    In theory this should have been caught earlier when the xattr list was
    verified, but in case it got missed, it's simple enough to add check
    to make sure we don't overrun the xattr buffer.
    
    This addresses CVE-2018-10879.
