    userns: Don't allow setgroups until a gid mapping has been setablished
    
    setgroups is unique in not needing a valid mapping before it can be called,
    in the case of setgroups(0, NULL) which drops all supplemental groups.
    
    The design of the user namespace assumes that CAP_SETGID can not actually
    be used until a gid mapping is established.  Therefore add a helper function
    to see if the user namespace gid mapping has been established and call
    that function in the setgroups permission check.
    
    This is part of the fix for CVE-2014-8989, being able to drop groups
    without privilege using user namespaces.
