    audit: EXECVE record - removed bogus newline
    
    (updated)
    Added hunk that changes the comment, the rest is the same.
    
    EXECVE records contain a newline after every argument. auditd converts
    "\n" to " " so you cannot see newlines even in raw logs, but they're
    there nevertheless. If you're not using auditd, you need to work round
    them. These '\n' chars are can be easily replaced by spaces when
    creating record in kernel. Note there is no need for trailing '\n' in
    an audit record.
    
    record before this patch:
    "type=EXECVE msg=audit(1231421801.566:31): argc=4 a0=\"./test\"\na1=\"a\"\na2=\"b\"\na3=\"c\"\n"
    
    record after this patch:
    "type=EXECVE msg=audit(1231421801.566:31): argc=4 a0=\"./test\" a1=\"a\" a2=\"b\" a3=\"c\""
