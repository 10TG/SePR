    Merge branch 'late-for-linus' of git://git.linaro.org/people/rmk/linux-arm
    
    Pull ARM update from Russell King:
     "This is the final round of stuff for ARM, left until the end of the
      merge window to reduce the number of conflicts.  This set contains the
      ARM part of David Howells UAPI changes, and a fix to the ordering of
      'select' statements in ARM Kconfig files (see the appropriate commit
      for why this happened - thanks to Andrew Morton for pointing out the
      problem.)
    
      I've left this as long as I dare for this window to avoid conflicts,
      and I regenerated the config patch yesterday, posting it to our
      mailing list for review and testing.  I have several acks which
      include successful test reports for it.
    
      However, today I notice we've got new conflicts with previously unseen
      code...  though that conflict should be trivial (it's my changes vs a
      one liner.)"
    
    * 'late-for-linus' of git://git.linaro.org/people/rmk/linux-arm:
      ARM: config: make sure that platforms are ordered by option string
      ARM: config: sort select statements alphanumerically
      UAPI: (Scripted) Disintegrate arch/arm/include/asm
    
    Fix up fairly conflict in arch/arm/Kconfig (the select re-organization
    vs recent addition of GENERIC_KERNEL_EXECVE)
