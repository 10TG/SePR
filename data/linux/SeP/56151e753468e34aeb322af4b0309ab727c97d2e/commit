    kgdb: don't needlessly skip PAGE_USER test for Fsl booke
    
    The bypassing of this test is a leftover from 2.4 vintage
    kernels, and is no longer appropriate, or even used by KGDB.
    Currently KGDB uses probe_kernel_write() for all access to
    memory via the KGDB core, so it can simply be deleted.
    
    This fixes CVE-2010-1446.
