    e1000e: enhance frame fragment detection
    
    Originally patched by Neil Horman <nhorman@tuxdriver.com>
    
    e1000e could with a jumbo frame enabled interface, and packet split disabled,
    receive a packet that would overflow a single rx buffer.  While in practice
    very hard to craft a packet that could abuse this, it is possible.
    
    this is related to CVE-2009-4538
