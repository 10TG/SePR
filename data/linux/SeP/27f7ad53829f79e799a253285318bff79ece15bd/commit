    ALSA: seq/oss - Fix double-free at error path of snd_seq_oss_open()
    
    The error handling in snd_seq_oss_open() has several bad codes that
    do dereferecing released pointers and double-free of kmalloc'ed data.
    The object dp is release in free_devinfo() that is called via
    private_free callback.  The rest shouldn't touch this object any more.
    
    The patch changes delete_port() to call kfree() in any case, and gets
    rid of unnecessary calls of destructors in snd_seq_oss_open().
    
    Fixes CVE-2010-3080.
