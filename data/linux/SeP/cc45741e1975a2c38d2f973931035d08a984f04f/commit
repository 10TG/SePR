    ARM: socfpga: Update socfpga_defconfig
    
    Enable the following bits:
    
    CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_STMPE
     - STMPE touchscreen support, needed on MCVEVK as it contains the
       chip. This also enables the STMPE MFD device and touchscreen
       input support.
    
    CONFIG_USB_STORAGE
     - USB storage support is often used, so enable it.
