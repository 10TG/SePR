    ====================
    wireless-drivers fixes for 5.3
    
    Fourth set of fixes for 5.3, and hopefully really the last one. Quite
    a few CVE fixes this time but at least to my knowledge none of them
    have a known exploit.
    
    mt76
    
    * workaround firmware hang by disabling hardware encryption on MT7630E
    
    * disable 5GHz band for MT7630E as it's not working properly
    
    mwifiex
    
    * fix IE parsing to avoid a heap buffer overflow
    
    iwlwifi
    
    * fix for QuZ device initialisation
    
    rt2x00
    
    * another fix for rekeying
    
    * revert a commit causing degradation in rx signal levels
    
    rsi
    
    * fix a double free
