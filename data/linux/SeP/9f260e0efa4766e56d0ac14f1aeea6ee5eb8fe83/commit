    CAN: Use inode instead of kernel address for /proc file
    
    Since the socket address is just being used as a unique identifier, its
    inode number is an alternative that does not leak potentially sensitive
    information.
    
    CC-ing stable because MITRE has assigned CVE-2010-4565 to the issue.
