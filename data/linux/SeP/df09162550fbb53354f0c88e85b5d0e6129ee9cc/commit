    tracing: t_start: reset FTRACE_ITER_HASH in case of seek/pread
    
    Be sure to avoid entering t_show() with FTRACE_ITER_HASH set without
    having properly started the iterator to iterate the hash.  This case is
    degenerate and, as discovered by Robert Swiecki, can cause t_hash_show()
    to misuse a pointer.  This causes a NULL ptr deref with possible security
    implications.  Tracked as CVE-2010-3079.
