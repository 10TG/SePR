    Pull random fixes from Ted Ts'o:
     "In reaction to the fixes to address CVE-2018-1108, some Linux
      distributions that have certain systemd versions in some cases
      combined with patches to libcrypt for FIPS/FEDRAMP compliance, have
      led to boot-time stalls for some hardware.
    
      The reaction by some distros and Linux sysadmins has been to install
      packages that try to do complicated things with the CPU and hope that
      leads to randomness.
    
      To mitigate this, if RDRAND is available, mix it into entropy provided
      by userspace. It won't hurt, and it will probably help"
