    Merge branch 'netback'
    
    Ian Campbell says:
    
    ====================
    The Xen netback implementation contains a couple of flaws which can
    allow a guest to cause a DoS in the backend domain, potentially
    affecting other domains in the system.
    
    CVE-2013-0216 is a failure to sanity check the ring producer/consumer
    pointers which can allow a guest to cause netback to loop for an
    extended period preventing other work from occurring.
    
    CVE-2013-0217 is a memory leak on an error path which is guest
    triggerable.
    
    The following series contains the fixes for these issues, as previously
    included in Xen Security Advisory 39:
