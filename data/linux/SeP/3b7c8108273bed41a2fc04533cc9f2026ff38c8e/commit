    [PATCH] smbfs chroot issue (CVE-2006-1864)
    
    Mark Moseley reported that a chroot environment on a SMB share can be left
    via "cd ..\\".  Similar to CVE-2006-1863 issue with cifs, this fix is for
    smbfs.

    Looks fine to me.  This should catch the slash on lookup or equivalent,
    which will be all obvious paths of interest.
