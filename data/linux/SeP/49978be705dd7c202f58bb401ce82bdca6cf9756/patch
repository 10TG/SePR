 who will help verify the bug report and develop and release a fix.

 Disclosure
 ----------
@@ -39,6 +42,32 @@ disclosure is from immediate (esp. if it's already publicly known)
 to a few weeks.  As a basic default policy, we expect report date to
 disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.
 
+Coordination
+------------
+
+Fixes for sensitive bugs, such as those that might lead to privilege
+escalations, may need to be coordinated with the private
+<linux-distros@vs.openwall.org> mailing list so that distribution vendors
+are well prepared to issue a fixed kernel upon public disclosure of the
+upstream fix. Distros will need some time to test the proposed patch and
+will generally request at least a few days of embargo, and vendor update
+publication prefers to happen Tuesday through Thursday. When appropriate,
+the security team can assist with this coordination, or the reporter can
+include linux-distros from the start. In this case, remember to prefix
+the email Subject line with "[vs]" as described in the linux-distros wiki:
+<http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists>
+
+CVE assignment
+--------------
+
+The security team does not normally assign CVEs, nor do we require them
+for reports or fixes, as this can needlessly complicate the process and
+may delay the bug handling. If a reporter wishes to have a CVE identifier
+assigned ahead of public disclosure, they will need to contact the private
+linux-distros list, described above. When such a CVE identifier is known
+before a patch is provided, it is desirable to mention it in the commit
+message, though.
