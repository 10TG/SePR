    docs: Clarify details for reporting security bugs
    
    The kernel security team is regularly asked to provide CVE identifiers,
    which we don't normally do. This updates the documentation to mention
    this and adds some more details about coordination and patch handling
    that come up regularly. Based on an earlier draft by Willy Tarreau.
