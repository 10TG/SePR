    kvm: vmx: handle invvpid vm exit gracefully
    
    On systems with invvpid instruction support (corresponding bit in
    IA32_VMX_EPT_VPID_CAP MSR is set) guest invocation of invvpid
    causes vm exit, which is currently not handled and results in
    propagation of unknown exit to userspace.
    
    Fix this by installing an invvpid vm exit handler.
    
    This is CVE-2014-3646.
