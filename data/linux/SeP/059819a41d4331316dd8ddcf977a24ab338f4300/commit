    [PATCH] Fix buffer overflow in Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (CVE-2007-0005)
    
    Based on a patch from Don Howard <dhoward@redhat.com>
    
    When calling write() with a buffer larger than 512 bytes, the
    driver's write buffer overflows, allowing to overwrite the EIP and
    execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
    
    In read(), there exists a similar problem, but coming from the device.
    A malicous or buggy device sending more than 512 bytes can overflow
    of the driver's read buffer, with the same effects as above.
