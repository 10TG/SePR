    block: do not pass disk names as format strings
    
    Disk names may contain arbitrary strings, so they must not be
    interpreted as format strings.  It seems that only md allows arbitrary
    strings to be used for disk names, but this could allow for a local
    memory corruption from uid 0 into ring 0.
