    KVM: Fix fs/gs reload oops with invalid ldt
    
    kvm reloads the host's fs and gs blindly, however the underlying segment
    descriptors may be invalid due to the user modifying the ldt after loading
    them.
    
    Fix by using the safe accessors (loadsegment() and load_gs_index()) instead
    of home grown unsafe versions.
    
    This is CVE-2010-3698.
