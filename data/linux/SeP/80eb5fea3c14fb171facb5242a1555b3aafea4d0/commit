    Merge tag 'powerpc-spectre-rsb' of powerpc-CVE-2019-18660.bundle
    
    Pull powerpc Spectre-RSB fixes from Michael Ellerman:
     "We failed to activate the mitigation for Spectre-RSB (Return Stack
      Buffer, aka. ret2spec) on context switch, on CPUs prior to Power9
      DD2.3.
    
      That allows a process to poison the RSB (called Link Stack on Power
      CPUs) and possibly misdirect speculative execution of another process.
      If the victim process can be induced to execute a leak gadget then it
      may be possible to extract information from the victim via a side
      channel.
    
      The fix is to correctly activate the link stack flush mitigation on
      all CPUs that have any mitigation of Spectre v2 in userspace enabled.
    
      There's a second commit which adds a link stack flush in the KVM guest
      exit path. A leak via that path has not been demonstrated, but we
      believe it's at least theoretically possible.
    
      This is the fix for CVE-2019-18660"
