    Fix for buffer overflow in ldm_frag_add not sufficient
    
    As Ben Hutchings discovered [1], the patch for CVE-2011-1017 (buffer
    overflow in ldm_frag_add) is not sufficient.  The original patch in
    commit c340b1d64000 ("fs/partitions/ldm.c: fix oops caused by corrupted
    partition table") does not consider that, for subsequent fragments,
    previously allocated memory is used.
