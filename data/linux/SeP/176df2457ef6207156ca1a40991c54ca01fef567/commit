    x86_64: Zero extend all registers after ptrace in 32bit entry path.
    
    Strictly it's only needed for eax.
    
    It actually does a little more than strictly needed -- the other registers
    are already zero extended.
    
    Also remove the now unnecessary and non functional compat task check
    in ptrace.
    
    This is CVE-2007-4573
