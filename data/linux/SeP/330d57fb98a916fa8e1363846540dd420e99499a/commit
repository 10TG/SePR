    [PATCH] Fix sysctl unregistration oops (CVE-2005-2709)
    
    You could open the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/<if>/<whatever> file, then
    wait for interface to go away, try to grab as much memory as possible in
    hope to hit the (kfreed) ctl_table.  Then fill it with pointers to your
    function.  Then do read from file you've opened and if you are lucky,
    you'll get it called as ->proc_handler() in kernel mode.
    
    So this is at least an Oops and possibly more.  It does depend on an
    interface going away though, so less of a security risk than it would
    otherwise be.
