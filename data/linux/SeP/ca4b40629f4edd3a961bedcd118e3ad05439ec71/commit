    Pull kgdb updates from Daniel Thompson:
     "Mostly cleanups but there are also a couple of fixes for out-of-bounds
      accesses (including a potential write to the byte before a static
      buffer).
    
      The main changes are:
    
       - Fixes to those out-of-bounds access (empty string to configure test
         module could write the byte before a buffer, high cpu counts could
         read outside of per-cpu structures).
    
       - Improvements to string handling problems picked up by new compiler
         warnings and other static checks. Most are fixing benign issues
         that can't be tickled without code changes but still reduce the wtf
         factor a little.
    
       - Tidy up the terminal output"
