    Pull device-mapper fix from Alasdair Kergon:
     "A patch to avoid data corruption in a device-mapper snapshot.
    
      This is primarily a data corruption bug that all users of
      device-mapper snapshots will want to fix.  The CVE is due to a data
      leak under specific circumstances if, for example, the snapshot is
      presented to a virtual machine: a block written as data inside the VM
      can get interpreted incorrectly on the host outside the VM as
      metadata, causing the host to provide the VM with access to blocks it
      would not otherwise see.  This is likely to affect few, if any,
      people"
