    [CVE-2009-0029] System call wrapper special cases
    
    System calls with an unsigned long long argument can't be converted with
    the standard wrappers since that would include a cast to long, which in
    turn means that we would lose the upper 32 bit on 32 bit architectures.
    Also semctl can't use the standard wrapper since it has a 'union'
    parameter.
    
    So we handle them as special case and add some extra wrappers instead.
