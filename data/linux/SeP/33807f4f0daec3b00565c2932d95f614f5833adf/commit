    Merge branch 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6
    
    Pull CIFS fixes from Steve French:
     "A fix for the problem which Al spotted in cifs_writev and a followup
      (noticed when fixing CVE-2014-0069) patch to ensure that cifs never
      sends more than the smb frame length over the socket (as we saw with
      that cifs_iovec_write problem that Jeff fixed last month)"
    
    * 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6:
      cifs: mask off top byte in get_rfc1002_length()
      cifs: sanity check length of data to send before sending
      CIFS: Fix wrong pos argument of cifs_find_lock_conflict
