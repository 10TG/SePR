    virtio-net: fix guest-triggerable buffer overrun
    
    When VM guest programs multicast addresses for
    a virtio net card, it supplies a 32 bit
    entries counter for the number of addresses.
    These addresses are read into tail portion of
    a fixed macs array which has size MAC_TABLE_ENTRIES,
    at offset equal to in_use.
    
    To avoid overflow of this array by guest, qemu attempts
    to test the size as follows:
    -    if (in_use + mac_data.entries <= MAC_TABLE_ENTRIES) {
    
    however, as mac_data.entries is uint32_t, this sum
    can overflow, e.g. if in_use is 1 and mac_data.entries
    is 0xffffffff then in_use + mac_data.entries will be 0.
    
    Qemu will then read guest supplied buffer into this
    memory, overflowing buffer on heap.
