    9pfs: local: symlink: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_symlink() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    calls:
    
    (1) symlink() which follows symbolic links for all path elements but the
        rightmost one
    (2) open(O_NOFOLLOW) which follows symbolic links for all path elements but
        the rightmost one
    (3) local_set_xattr()->setxattr() which follows symbolic links for all
        path elements
    (4) local_set_mapped_file_attr() which calls in turn local_fopen() and
        mkdir(), both functions following symbolic links for all path
        elements but the rightmost one
    
    This patch converts local_symlink() to rely on opendir_nofollow() and
    symlinkat() to fix (1), openat(O_NOFOLLOW) to fix (2), as well as
    local_set_xattrat() and local_set_mapped_file_attrat() to fix (3) and
    (4) respectively.
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
