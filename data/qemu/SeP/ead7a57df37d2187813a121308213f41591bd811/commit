    ssd0323: fix buffer overun on invalid state load
    
    CVE-2013-4538
    
    s->cmd_len used as index in ssd0323_transfer() to store 32-bit field.
    Possible this field might then be supplied by guest to overwrite a
    return addr somewhere. Same for row/col fields, which are indicies into
    framebuffer array.
    
    To fix validate after load.
    
    Additionally, validate that the row/col_start/end are within bounds;
    otherwise the guest can provoke an overrun by either setting the _end
    field so large that the row++ increments just walk off the end of the
    array, or by setting the _start value to something bogus and then
    letting the "we hit end of row" logic reset row to row_start.
    
    For completeness, validate mode as well.
