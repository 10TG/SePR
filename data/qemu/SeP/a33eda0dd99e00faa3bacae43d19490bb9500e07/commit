    9pfs: local: utimensat: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_utimensat() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    calls qemu_utimens()->utimensat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW) which follows symbolic
    links in all path elements but the rightmost one or qemu_utimens()->utimes()
    which follows symbolic links for all path elements.
    
    This patch converts local_utimensat() to rely on opendir_nofollow() and
    utimensat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW) directly instead of using qemu_utimens().
    It is hence assumed that the OS supports utimensat(), i.e. has glibc 2.6
    or higher and linux 2.6.22 or higher, which seems reasonable nowadays.
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
