    virtio-blk: refuse SG_IO requests with scsi=off
    
    QEMU does have a "scsi" option (to be used like -device
    virtio-blk-pci,drive=foo,scsi=off).  However, it only
    masks the feature bit, and does not reject the command
    if a malicious guest disregards the feature bits and
    issues a request.
    
    Without this patch, using scsi=off does not protect you
    from CVE-2011-4127.
