    usb: limit combined packets to 1 MiB (CVE-2021-3527)
    
    usb-host and usb-redirect try to batch bulk transfers by combining many
    small usb packets into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the
    overhead and improve performance.
    
    This patch adds a size limit of 1 MiB for those combined packets to
    restrict the host resources the guest can bind that way.
