    virtiofs: drop remapped security.capability xattr as needed
    
    On Linux, the 'security.capability' xattr holds a set of
    capabilities that can change when an executable is run, giving
    a limited form of privilege escalation to those programs that
    the writer of the file deemed worthy.
    
    Any write causes the 'security.capability' xattr to be dropped,
    stopping anyone from gaining privilege by modifying a blessed
    file.
    
    Fuse relies on the daemon to do this dropping, and in turn the
    daemon relies on the host kernel to drop the xattr for it.  However,
    with the addition of -o xattrmap, the xattr that the guest
    stores its capabilities in is now not the same as the one that
    the host kernel automatically clears.
    
    Where the mapping changes 'security.capability', explicitly clear
    the remapped name to preserve the same behaviour.
    
    This bug is assigned CVE-2021-20263.
