    9pfs: local: mknod: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_mknod() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    calls:
    
    (1) mknod() which follows symbolic links for all path elements but the
        rightmost one
    (2) local_set_xattr()->setxattr() which follows symbolic links for all
        path elements
    (3) local_set_mapped_file_attr() which calls in turn local_fopen() and
        mkdir(), both functions following symbolic links for all path
        elements but the rightmost one
    (4) local_post_create_passthrough() which calls in turn lchown() and
        chmod(), both functions also following symbolic links
    
    This patch converts local_mknod() to rely on opendir_nofollow() and
    mknodat() to fix (1), as well as local_set_xattrat() and
    local_set_mapped_file_attrat() to fix (2) and (3) respectively.
    
    A new local_set_cred_passthrough() helper based on fchownat() and
    fchmodat_nofollow() is introduced as a replacement to
    local_post_create_passthrough() to fix (4).
    
    The mapped and mapped-file security modes are supposed to be identical,
    except for the place where credentials and file modes are stored. While
    here, we also make that explicit by sharing the call to mknodat().
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
