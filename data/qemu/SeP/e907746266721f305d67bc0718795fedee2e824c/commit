    fdc: force the fifo access to be in bounds of the allocated buffer
    
    During processing of certain commands such as FD_CMD_READ_ID and
    FD_CMD_DRIVE_SPECIFICATION_COMMAND the fifo memory access could
    get out of bounds leading to memory corruption with values coming
    from the guest.
    
    Fix this by making sure that the index is always bounded by the
    allocated memory.
    
    This is CVE-2015-3456.
