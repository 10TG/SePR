    CVE-2015-1779: limit size of HTTP headers from websockets clients
    
    The VNC server websockets decoder will read and buffer data from
    websockets clients until it sees the end of the HTTP headers,
    as indicated by \r\n\r\n. In theory this allows a malicious to
    trick QEMU into consuming an arbitrary amount of RAM. In practice,
    because QEMU runs g_strstr_len() across the buffered header data,
    it will spend increasingly long burning CPU time searching for
    the substring match and less & less time reading data. So while
    this does cause arbitrary memory growth, the bigger problem is
    that QEMU will be burning 100% of available CPU time.
    
    A novnc websockets client typically sends headers of around
    512 bytes in length. As such it is reasonable to place a 4096
    byte limit on the amount of data buffered while searching for
    the end of HTTP headers.
