    ide: Check array bounds before writing to io_buffer (CVE-2015-5154)
    
    If the end_transfer_func of a command is called because enough data has
    been read or written for the current PIO transfer, and it fails to
    correctly call the command completion functions, the DRQ bit in the
    status register and s->end_transfer_func may remain set. This allows the
    guest to access further bytes in s->io_buffer beyond s->data_end, and
    eventually overflowing the io_buffer.
    
    One case where this currently happens is emulation of the ATAPI command
    START STOP UNIT.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by adding explicit array bounds checks
    before accessing the buffer instead of relying on end_transfer_func to
    function correctly.
