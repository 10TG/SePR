    9p: take write lock on fid path updates (CVE-2018-19364)
    
    Recent commit 5b76ef50f62079a fixed a race where v9fs_co_open2() could
    possibly overwrite a fid path with v9fs_path_copy() while it is being
    accessed by some other thread, ie, use-after-free that can be detected
    by ASAN with a custom 9p client.
    
    It turns out that the same can happen at several locations where
    v9fs_path_copy() is used to set the fid path. The fix is again to
    take the write lock.
    
    Fixes CVE-2018-19364.
