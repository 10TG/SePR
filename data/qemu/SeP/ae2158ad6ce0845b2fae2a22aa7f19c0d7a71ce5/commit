    ahci: fix buffer overrun on invalid state load
    
    CVE-2013-4526
    
    Within hw/ide/ahci.c, VARRAY refers to ports which is also loaded.  So
    we use the old version of ports to read the array but then allow any
    value for ports.  This can cause the code to overflow.
    
    There's no reason to migrate ports - it never changes.
    So just make sure it matches.
