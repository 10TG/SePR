    curl: check data size before memcpy to local buffer. (CVE-2014-0144)
    
    curl_read_cb is callback function for libcurl when data arrives. The
    data size passed in here is not guaranteed to be within the range of
    request we submitted, so we may overflow the guest IO buffer. Check the
    real size we have before memcpy to buffer to avoid overflow.
