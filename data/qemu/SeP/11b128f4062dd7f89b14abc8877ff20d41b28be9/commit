    qcow2: Fix NULL dereference in qcow2_open() error path (CVE-2014-0146)
    
    The qcow2 code assumes that s->snapshots is non-NULL if s->nb_snapshots
    != 0. By having the initialisation of both fields separated in
    qcow2_open(), any error occuring in between would cause the error path
    to dereference NULL in qcow2_free_snapshots() if the image had any
    snapshots.
