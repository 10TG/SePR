    vpc/vhd: add bounds check for max_table_entries and block_size (CVE-2014-0144)
    
    This adds checks to make sure that max_table_entries and block_size
    are in sane ranges.  Memory is allocated based on max_table_entries,
    and block_size is used to calculate indices into that allocated
    memory, so if these values are incorrect that can lead to potential
    unbounded memory allocation, or invalid memory accesses.
    
    Also, the allocation of the pagetable is changed from g_malloc0()
    to qemu_blockalign().
