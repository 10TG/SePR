    openpic: avoid buffer overrun on incoming migration
    
    CVE-2013-4534
    
    opp->nb_cpus is read from the wire and used to determine how many
    IRQDest elements to read into opp->dst[]. If the value exceeds the
    length of opp->dst[], MAX_CPU, opp->dst[] can be overrun with arbitrary
    data from the wire.
    
    Fix this by failing migration if the value read from the wire exceeds
    MAX_CPU.
