    9pfs: local: chown: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_chown() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    calls:
    
    (1) lchown() which follows symbolic links for all path elements but the
        rightmost one
    (2) local_set_xattr()->setxattr() which follows symbolic links for all
        path elements
    (3) local_set_mapped_file_attr() which calls in turn local_fopen() and
        mkdir(), both functions following symbolic links for all path
        elements but the rightmost one
    
    This patch converts local_chown() to rely on open_nofollow() and
    fchownat() to fix (1), as well as local_set_xattrat() and
    local_set_mapped_file_attrat() to fix (2) and (3) respectively.
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
