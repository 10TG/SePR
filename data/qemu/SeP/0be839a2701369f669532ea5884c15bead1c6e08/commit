    migration: fix parameter validation on ram load
    
    During migration, the values read from migration stream during ram load
    are not validated. Especially offset in host_from_stream_offset() and
    also the length of the writes in the callers of said function.
    
    To fix this, we need to make sure that the [offset, offset + length]
    range fits into one of the allocated memory regions.
    
    Validating addr < len should be sufficient since data seems to always be
    managed in TARGET_PAGE_SIZE chunks.
    
    Fixes: CVE-2014-7840
    
    Note: follow-up patches add extra checks on each block->host access.
