    cirrus: fix blit region check
    
    Issues:
     * Doesn't check pitches correctly in case it is negative.
     * Doesn't check width at all.
    
    Turn macro into functions while being at it, also factor out the check
    for one region which we then can simply call twice for src + dst.
    
    This is CVE-2014-8106.
