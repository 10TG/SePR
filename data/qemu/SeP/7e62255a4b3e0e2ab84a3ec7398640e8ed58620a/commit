    ccid: Fix buffer overrun in handling of VSC_ATR message
    
    ATR size exceeding the limit is diagnosed, but then we merrily use it
    anyway, overrunning card->atr[].
    
    The message is read from a character device.  Obvious security
    implications unless the other end of the character device is trusted.
    
    Spotted by Coverity.  CVE-2011-4111.
