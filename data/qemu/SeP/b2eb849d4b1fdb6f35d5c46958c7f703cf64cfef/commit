    CVE-2007-1320 - Cirrus LGD-54XX "bitblt" heap overflow
    
    I have just noticed that patch for CVE-2007-1320 has never been applied
    to the QEMU CVS. Please find it below.
    
    | Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the cirrus_invalidate_region
    | function in the Cirrus VGA extension in QEMU 0.8.2, as used in Xen and
    | possibly other products, might allow local users to execute arbitrary
    | code via unspecified vectors related to "attempting to mark
    | non-existent regions as dirty," aka the "bitblt" heap overflow.
