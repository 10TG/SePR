    memory: Revert "memory: accept mismatching sizes in memory_region_access_valid"
    
    Memory API documentation documents valid .min_access_size and .max_access_size
    fields and explains that any access outside these boundaries is blocked.
    
    This is what devices seem to assume.
    
    However this is not what the implementation does: it simply
    ignores the boundaries unless there's an "accepts" callback.
    
    Naturally, this breaks a bunch of devices.
    
    Revert to the documented behaviour.
    
    Devices that want to allow any access can just drop the valid field,
    or add the impl field to have accesses converted to appropriate
    length.
