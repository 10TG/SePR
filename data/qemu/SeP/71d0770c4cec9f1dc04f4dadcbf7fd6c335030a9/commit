    Fix CVE-2008-0928 - insufficient block device address range checking (Anthony Liguori)
    
    Introduce a growable flag that's set by bdrv_file_open().  Block devices should
    never be growable, only files that are being used by block devices.
    
    I went through Fabrice's early comments about the patch that was first applied.
    While I disagree with that patch, I also disagree with Fabrice's suggestion.
    
    There's no good reason to do the checks in the block drivers themselves.  It
    just increases the possibility that this bug could show up again.  Since we're
    calling bdrv_getlength() to determine the length, we're giving the block drivers
    a chance to chime in and let us know what range is valid.
    
    Basically, this patch makes the BlockDriver API guarantee that all requests are
    within 0..bdrv_getlength() which to me seems like a Good Thing.
    
    What do others think?
