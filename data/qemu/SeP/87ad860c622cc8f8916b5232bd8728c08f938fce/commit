    nvme: fix out-of-bounds access to the CMB
    
    Because the CMB BAR has a min_access_size of 2, if you read the last
    byte it will try to memcpy *2* bytes from n->cmbuf, causing an off-by-one
    error.  This is CVE-2018-16847.
    
    Another way to fix this might be to register the CMB as a RAM memory
    region, which would also be more efficient.  However, that might be a
    change for big-endian machines; I didn't think this through and I don't
    know how real hardware works.  Add a basic testcase for the CMB in case
    somebody does this change later on.
