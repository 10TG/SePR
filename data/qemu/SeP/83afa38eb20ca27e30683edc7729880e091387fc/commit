    vmware-vga: CVE-2014-3689: turn off hw accel
    
    Quick & easy stopgap for CVE-2014-3689:  We just compile out the
    hardware acceleration functions which lack sanity checks.  Thankfully
    we have capability bits for them (SVGA_CAP_RECT_COPY and
    SVGA_CAP_RECT_FILL), so guests should deal just fine, in theory.
    
    Subsequent patches will add the missing checks and re-enable the
    hardware acceleration emulation.
