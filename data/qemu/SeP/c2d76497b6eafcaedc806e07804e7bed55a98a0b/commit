    block: prevent snapshot mode $TMPDIR symlink attack
    
    In snapshot mode, bdrv_open creates an empty temporary file without
    checking for mkstemp or close failure, and ignoring the possibility
    of a buffer overrun given a surprisingly long $TMPDIR.
    Change the get_tmp_filename function to return int (not void),
    so that it can inform its two callers of those failures.
    Also avoid the risk of buffer overrun and do not ignore mkstemp
    or close failure.
    Update both callers (in block.c and vvfat.c) to propagate
    temp-file-creation failure to their callers.
    
    get_tmp_filename creates and closes an empty file, while its
    callers later open that presumed-existing file with O_CREAT.
    The problem was that a malicious user could provoke mkstemp failure
    and race to create a symlink with the selected temporary file name,
    thus causing the qemu process (usually root owned) to open through
    the symlink, overwriting an attacker-chosen file.
    
    This addresses CVE-2012-2652.
