    virtiofsd: Pull 2020-05-01 (includes CVE fix)
    
    This set includes a security fix, other fixes and improvements.
    
    Security fix:
    The security fix is for CVE-2020-10717 where, on low RAM hosts,
    the guest can potentially exceed the maximum fd limit.
    This fix adds some more configuration so that the user
    can explicitly set the limit.
    
    Fixes:
    
    Recursive mounting of the exported directory is now used in
    the sandbox, such that if there was a mount underneath present at
    the time the virtiofsd was started, that mount is also
    visible to the guest; in the existing code, only mounts that
    happened after startup were visible.
    
    Security improvements:
    
    The jailing for /proc/self/fd is improved - but it's something
    that shouldn't be accessible anyway.
    
    Most capabilities are now dropped at startup; again this shouldn't
    change any behaviour but is extra protection.
