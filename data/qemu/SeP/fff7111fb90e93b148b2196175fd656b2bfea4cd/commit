    fuzz: add virtio-9p configurations for fuzzing
    
    virtio-9p devices are often used to expose a virtual-filesystem to the
    guest. There have been some bugs reported in this device, such as
    CVE-2018-19364, and CVE-2021-20181. We should fuzz this device
    
    This patch adds two virtio-9p configurations:
     * One with the widely used -fsdev local driver. This driver leaks some
       state in the form of files/directories created in the shared dir.
     * One with the synth driver. While it is not used in the real world, this
       driver won't leak leak state between fuzz inputs.
