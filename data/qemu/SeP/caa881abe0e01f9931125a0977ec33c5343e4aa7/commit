    pxa2xx: avoid buffer overrun on incoming migration
    
    CVE-2013-4533
    
    s->rx_level is read from the wire and used to determine how many bytes
    to subsequently read into s->rx_fifo[]. If s->rx_level exceeds the
    length of s->rx_fifo[] the buffer can be overrun with arbitrary data
    from the wire.
    
    Fix this by validating rx_level against the size of s->rx_fifo.
