    9pfs: local: link: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_link() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it calls:
    
    (1) link() which follows symbolic links for all path elements but the
        rightmost one
    (2) local_create_mapped_attr_dir()->mkdir() which follows symbolic links
        for all path elements but the rightmost one
    
    This patch converts local_link() to rely on opendir_nofollow() and linkat()
    to fix (1), mkdirat() to fix (2).
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
