    i386: Add new -IBRS versions of Intel CPU models
    
    The new MSR IA32_SPEC_CTRL MSR was introduced by a recent Intel
    microcode updated and can be used by OSes to mitigate
    CVE-2017-5715.  Unfortunately we can't change the existing CPU
    models without breaking existing setups, so users need to
    explicitly update their VM configuration to use the new *-IBRS
    CPU model if they want to expose IBRS to guests.
    
    The new CPU models are simple copies of the existing CPU models,
    with just CPUID_7_0_EDX_SPEC_CTRL added and model_id updated.
