    scsi: lsi: exit infinite loop while executing script (CVE-2019-12068)
    
    When executing script in lsi_execute_script(), the LSI scsi adapter
    emulator advances 's->dsp' index to read next opcode. This can lead
    to an infinite loop if the next opcode is empty. Move the existing
    loop exit after 10k iterations so that it covers no-op opcodes as
    well.
