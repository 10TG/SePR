    dmg: sanitize chunk length and sectorcount (CVE-2014-0145)
    
    Chunk length and sectorcount are used for decompression buffers as well
    as the bdrv_pread() count argument.  Ensure that they have reasonable
    values so neither memory allocation nor conversion from uint64_t to int
    will cause problems.
