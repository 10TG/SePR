    9pfs: local: remove: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_remove() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    calls:
    
    (1) lstat() which follows symbolic links in all path elements but the
        rightmost one
    (2) remove() which follows symbolic links in all path elements but the
        rightmost one
    
    This patch converts local_remove() to rely on opendir_nofollow(),
    fstatat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW) to fix (1) and unlinkat() to fix (2).
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
