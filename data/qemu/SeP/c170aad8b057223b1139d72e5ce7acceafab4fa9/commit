    scsi: fix buffer overflow in scsi_req_parse_cdb (CVE-2015-5158)
    
    This is a guest-triggerable buffer overflow present in QEMU 2.2.0
    and newer.  scsi_cdb_length returns -1 as an error value, but the
    caller does not check it.
    
    Luckily, the massive overflow means that QEMU will just SIGSEGV,
    making the impact much smaller.
