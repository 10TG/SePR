    hw/net/stellaris_enet: Convert to vmstate
    
    Convert this device to use vmstate for its save/load, including
    providing a post_load function that sanitizes inbound data to
    avoid possible buffer overflows if it is malicious.
    
    The sanitizing fixes CVE-2013-4532 (though nobody should be
    relying on the security properties of most of the unmaintained
    ARM board models anyway, and migration doesn't actually
    work on this board due to issues in other device models).
