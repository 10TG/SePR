    qcow2: Check backing_file_offset (CVE-2014-0144)
    
    Header, header extension and the backing file name must all be stored in
    the first cluster. Setting the backing file to a much higher value
    allowed header extensions to become much bigger than we want them to be
    (unbounded allocation).
