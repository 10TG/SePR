    cirrus: Fix host CPU blits
    
    Commit b2eb849d4b1fdb6f35d5c46958c7f703cf64cfef
    "CVE-2007-1320 - Cirrus LGD-54XX "bitblt" heap overflow" broke
    cpu to video blits.
    
    When the ROP function is called from cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo_next(),
    we pass 0 for the pitch but only operate on one line at a time. The
    added test was tripping because after the initial substraction, the
    pitch becomes negative. Make the test only trip when the height is
    larger than one (ie. the pitch is actually used).
    
    This fixes HW cursor support in Windows NT4.0 (which otherwise was
    a white rectangle) and general display of icons in that OS when using
    8bpp mode.
