    vnc: sanitize bits_per_pixel from the client
    
    bits_per_pixel that are less than 8 could result in accessing
    non-initialized buffers later in the code due to the expectation
    that bytes_per_pixel value that is used to initialize these buffers is
    never zero.
    
    To fix this check that bits_per_pixel from the client is one of the
    values that the rfb protocol specification allows.
    
    This is CVE-2014-7815.
