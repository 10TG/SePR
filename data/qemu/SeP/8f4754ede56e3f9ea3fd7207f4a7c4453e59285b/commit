    block: Limit request size (CVE-2014-0143)
    
    Limiting the size of a single request to INT_MAX not only fixes a
    direct integer overflow in bdrv_check_request() (which would only
    trigger bad behaviour with ridiculously huge images, as in close to
    2^64 bytes), but can also prevent overflows in all block drivers.
