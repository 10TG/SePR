    9pfs: local: renameat: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_renameat() callback is currently a wrapper around local_rename()
    which is vulnerable to symlink attacks.
    
    This patch rewrites local_renameat() to have its own implementation, based
    on local_opendir_nofollow() and renameat().
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
