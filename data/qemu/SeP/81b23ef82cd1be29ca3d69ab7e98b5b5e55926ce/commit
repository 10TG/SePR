commit 81b23ef82cd1be29ca3d69ab7e98b5b5e55926ce

    xen: limit guest control of PCI command register
    
    Otherwise the guest can abuse that control to cause e.g. PCIe
    Unsupported Request responses (by disabling memory and/or I/O decoding
    and subsequently causing [CPU side] accesses to the respective address
    ranges), which (depending on system configuration) may be fatal to the
    host.
    
    This is CVE-2015-2756 / XSA-126.
