    scsi: Allocate SCSITargetReq r->buf dynamically [CVE-2013-4344]
    
    r->buf is hardcoded to 2056 which is (256 + 1) * 8, allowing 256 luns at
    most. If more than 256 luns are specified by user, we have buffer
    overflow in scsi_target_emulate_report_luns.
    
    To fix, we allocate the buffer dynamically.
