    vnc: fix memory corruption (CVE-2015-5225)
    
    The _cmp_bytes variable added by commit "bea60dd ui/vnc: fix potential
    memory corruption issues" can become negative.  Result is (possibly
    exploitable) memory corruption.  Reason for that is it uses the stride
    instead of bytes per scanline to apply limits.
    
    For the server surface is is actually fine.  vnc creates that itself,
    there is never any padding and thus scanline length always equals stride.
    
    For the guest surface scanline length and stride are typically identical
    too, but it doesn't has to be that way.  So add and use a new variable
    (guest_ll) for the guest scanline length.  Also rename min_stride to
    line_bytes to make more clear what it actually is.  Finally sprinkle
    in an assert() to make sure we never use a negative _cmp_bytes again.
