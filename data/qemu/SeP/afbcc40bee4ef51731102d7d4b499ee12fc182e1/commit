    parallels: Fix catalog size integer overflow (CVE-2014-0143)
    
    The first test case would cause a huge memory allocation, leading to a
    qemu abort; the second one to a too small malloc() for the catalog
    (smaller than s->catalog_size), which causes a read-only out-of-bounds
    array access and on big endian hosts an endianess conversion for an
    undefined memory area.
    
    The sample image used here is not an original Parallels image. It was
    created using an hexeditor on the basis of the struct that qemu uses.
    Good enough for trying to crash the driver, but not for ensuring
    compatibility.
