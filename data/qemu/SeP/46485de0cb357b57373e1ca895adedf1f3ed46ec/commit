    qcow1: Validate image size (CVE-2014-0223)
    
    A huge image size could cause s->l1_size to overflow. Make sure that
    images never require a L1 table larger than what fits in s->l1_size.
    
    This cannot only cause unbounded allocations, but also the allocation of
    a too small L1 table, resulting in out-of-bounds array accesses (both
    reads and writes).
