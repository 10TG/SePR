    hw/sd/sdcard: Do not switch to ReceivingData if address is invalid
    
    Only move the state machine to ReceivingData if there is no
    pending error. This avoids later OOB access while processing
    commands queued.
    
      "SD Specifications Part 1 Physical Layer Simplified Spec. v3.01"
    
      4.3.3 Data Read
    
      Read command is rejected if BLOCK_LEN_ERROR or ADDRESS_ERROR
      occurred and no data transfer is performed.
    
      4.3.4 Data Write
    
      Write command is rejected if BLOCK_LEN_ERROR or ADDRESS_ERROR
      occurred and no data transfer is performed.
    
    WP_VIOLATION errors are not modified: the error bit is set, we
    stay in receive-data state, wait for a stop command. All further
    data transfer is ignored. See the check on sd->card_status at the
    beginning of sd_read_data() and sd_write_data().
