    vmstate: fix buffer overflow in target-arm/machine.c
    
    CVE-2013-4531
    
    cpreg_vmstate_indexes is a VARRAY_INT32. A negative value for
    cpreg_vmstate_array_len will cause a buffer overflow.
    
    VMSTATE_INT32_LE was supposed to protect against this
    but doesn't because it doesn't validate that input is
    non-negative.
    
    Fix this macro to valide the value appropriately.
    
    The only other user of VMSTATE_INT32_LE doesn't
    ever use negative numbers so it doesn't care.
