    9pfs: local: readlink: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_readlink() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    calls:
    
    (1) open(O_NOFOLLOW) which follows symbolic links for all path elements but
        the rightmost one
    (2) readlink() which follows symbolic links for all path elements but the
        rightmost one
    
    This patch converts local_readlink() to rely on open_nofollow() to fix (1)
    and opendir_nofollow(), readlinkat() to fix (2).
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
