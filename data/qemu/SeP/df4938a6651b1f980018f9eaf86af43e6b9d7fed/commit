    9pfs: local: unlinkat: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_unlinkat() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    calls remove() which follows symbolic links in all path elements but the
    rightmost one.
    
    This patch converts local_unlinkat() to rely on opendir_nofollow() and
    unlinkat() instead.
    
    Most of the code is moved to a separate local_unlinkat_common() helper
    which will be reused in a subsequent patch to fix the same issue in
    local_remove().
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
