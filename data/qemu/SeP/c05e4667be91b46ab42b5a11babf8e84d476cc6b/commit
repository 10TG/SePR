    qcow2: Fix L1 allocation size in qcow2_snapshot_load_tmp() (CVE-2014-0145)
    
    For the L1 table to loaded for an internal snapshot, the code allocated
    only enough memory to hold the currently active L1 table. If the
    snapshot's L1 table is actually larger than the current one, this leads
    to a buffer overflow.
