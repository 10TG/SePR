    i8254: fix out-of-bounds memory access in pit_ioport_read()
    
    Due converting PIO to the new memory read/write api we no longer provide
    separate I/O region lenghts for read and write operations. As a result,
    reading from PIT Mode/Command register will end with accessing
    pit->channels with invalid index.
    
    Fix this by ignoring read from the Mode/Command register.
    
    This is CVE-2015-3214.
