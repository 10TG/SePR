    9pfs: local: rename: use renameat
    
    The local_rename() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    uses rename() which follows symbolic links in all path elements but the
    rightmost one.
    
    This patch simply transforms local_rename() into a wrapper around
    local_renameat() which is symlink-attack safe.
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
