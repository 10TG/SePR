    vmsvga: shadow fifo registers
    
    The fifo is normal ram.  So kvm vcpu threads and qemu iothread can
    access the fifo in parallel without syncronization.  Which in turn
    implies we can't use the fifo pointers in-place because the guest
    can try changing them underneath us.  So add shadows for them, to
    make sure the guest can't modify them after we've applied sanity
    checks.
    
    Fixes: CVE-2016-4454
