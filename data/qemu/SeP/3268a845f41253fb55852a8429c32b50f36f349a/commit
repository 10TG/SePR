    audio: release capture buffers
    
    AUD_add_capture() allocates two buffers which are never released.
    Add the missing calls to AUD_del_capture().
    
    Impact: Allows vnc clients to exhaust host memory by repeatedly
    starting and stopping audio capture.
    
    Fixes: CVE-2017-8309
