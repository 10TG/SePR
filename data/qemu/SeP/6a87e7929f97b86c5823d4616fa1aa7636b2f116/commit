    9pfs: local: fix unlink of alien files in mapped-file mode
    
    When trying to remove a file from a directory, both created in non-mapped
    mode, the file remains and EBADF is returned to the guest.
    
    This is a regression introduced by commit "df4938a6651b 9pfs: local:
    unlinkat: don't follow symlinks" when fixing CVE-2016-9602. It changed the
    way we unlink the metadata file from
    
        ret = remove("$dir/.virtfs_metadata/$name");
        if (ret < 0 && errno != ENOENT) {
             /* Error out */
        }
        /* Ignore absence of metadata */
    
    to
    
        fd = openat("$dir/.virtfs_metadata")
        unlinkat(fd, "$name")
        if (ret < 0 && errno != ENOENT) {
             /* Error out */
        }
        /* Ignore absence of metadata */
    
    If $dir was created in non-mapped mode, openat() fails with ENOENT and
    we pass -1 to unlinkat(), which fails in turn with EBADF.
    
    We just need to check the return of openat() and ignore ENOENT, in order
    to restore the behaviour we had with remove().
