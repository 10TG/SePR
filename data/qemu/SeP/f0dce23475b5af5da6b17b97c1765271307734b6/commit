    dmg: prevent chunk buffer overflow (CVE-2014-0145)
    
    Both compressed and uncompressed I/O is buffered.  dmg_open() calculates
    the maximum buffer size needed from the metadata in the image file.
    
    There is currently a buffer overflow since ->lengths[] is accounted
    against the maximum compressed buffer size but actually uses the
    uncompressed buffer:
    
      switch (s->types[chunk]) {
      case 1: /* copy */
          ret = bdrv_pread(bs->file, s->offsets[chunk],
                           s->uncompressed_chunk, s->lengths[chunk]);
    
    We must account against the maximum uncompressed buffer size for type=1
    chunks.
    
    This patch fixes the maximum buffer size calculation to take into
    account the chunk type.  It is critical that we update the correct
    maximum since there are two buffers ->compressed_chunk and
    ->uncompressed_chunk.
