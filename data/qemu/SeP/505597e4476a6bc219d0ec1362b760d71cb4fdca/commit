    Ignore pci unplug requests for unpluggable devices (CVE-2011-1751)
    
    This patch makes qemu ignore unplug requests from the guest for pci
    devices which are tagged as non-hotpluggable.  Trouble spot is the
    piix4 chipset with the ISA bridge.  Requests to unplug that one will
    make it go away together with all ISA bus devices, which are not
    prepared to be unplugged and thus don't cleanup, leaving active
    qemu timers behind in free'ed memory.
