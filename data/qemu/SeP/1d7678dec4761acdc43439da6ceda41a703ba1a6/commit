    vhdx: Bounds checking for block_size and logical_sector_size (CVE-2014-0148)
    
    Other variables (e.g. sectors_per_block) are calculated using these
    variables, and if not range-checked illegal values could be obtained
    causing infinite loops and other potential issues when calculating
    BAT entries.
    
    The 1.00 VHDX spec requires BlockSize to be min 1MB, max 256MB.
    LogicalSectorSize is required to be either 512 or 4096 bytes.
