    9pfs: local: lstat: don't follow symlinks
    
    The local_lstat() callback is vulnerable to symlink attacks because it
    calls:
    
    (1) lstat() which follows symbolic links in all path elements but the
        rightmost one
    (2) getxattr() which follows symbolic links in all path elements
    (3) local_mapped_file_attr()->local_fopen()->openat(O_NOFOLLOW) which
        follows symbolic links in all path elements but the rightmost
        one
    
    This patch converts local_lstat() to rely on opendir_nofollow() and
    fstatat(AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW) to fix (1), fgetxattrat_nofollow() to
    fix (2).
    
    A new local_fopenat() helper is introduced as a replacement to
    local_fopen() to fix (3). No effort is made to factor out code
    because local_fopen() will be dropped when all users have been
    converted to call local_fopenat().
    
    This partly fixes CVE-2016-9602.
