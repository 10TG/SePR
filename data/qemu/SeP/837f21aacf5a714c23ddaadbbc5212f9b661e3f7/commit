    net: pcnet: add check to validate receive data size(CVE-2015-7504)
    
    In loopback mode, pcnet_receive routine appends CRC code to the
    receive buffer. If the data size given is same as the buffer size,
    the appended CRC code overwrites 4 bytes after s->buffer. Added a
    check to avoid that.
