    virtiofsd: stay below fs.file-max sysctl value (CVE-2020-10717)
    
    The system-wide fs.file-max sysctl value determines how many files can
    be open.  It defaults to a value calculated based on the machine's RAM
    size.  Previously virtiofsd would try to set RLIMIT_NOFILE to 1,000,000
    and this allowed the FUSE client to exhaust the number of open files
    system-wide on Linux hosts with less than 10 GB of RAM!
    
    Take fs.file-max into account when choosing the default RLIMIT_NOFILE
    value.
