    block/cloop: refuse images with bogus offsets (CVE-2014-0144)
    
    The offsets[] array allows efficient seeking and tells us the maximum
    compressed data size.  If the offsets are bogus the maximum compressed
    data size will be unrealistic.
    
    This could cause g_malloc() to abort and bogus offsets mean the image is
    broken anyway.  Therefore we should refuse such images.
