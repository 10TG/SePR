    e1000: Avoid infinite loop in processing transmit descriptor (CVE-2015-6815)
    
    While processing transmit descriptors, it could lead to an infinite
    loop if 'bytes' was to become zero; Add a check to avoid it.
    
    [The guest can force 'bytes' to 0 by setting the hdr_len and mss
    descriptor fields to 0.
