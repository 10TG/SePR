    hmp: fix sendkey out of bounds write (CVE-2015-8619)
    
    When processing 'sendkey' command, hmp_sendkey routine null
    terminates the 'keyname_buf' array. This results in an OOB
    write issue, if 'keyname_len' was to fall outside of
    'keyname_buf' array.
    
    Since the keyname's length is known the keyname_buf can be
    removed altogether by adding a length parameter to
    index_from_key() and using it for the error output as well.
