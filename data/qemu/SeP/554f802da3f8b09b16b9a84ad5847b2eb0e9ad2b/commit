    hw/pcie: better hotplug/hotunplug support
    
    The current code is broken: it does surprise removal which crashes guests.
    
    Reimplemented the steps:
     - Hotplug triggers both 'present detect change' and
       'attention button pressed'.
    
     - Hotunplug starts by triggering 'attention button pressed',
       then waits for the OS to power off the device and only
       then detaches it.
    
    Fixes CVE-2014-3471.
