    block/cloop: validate block_size header field (CVE-2014-0144)
    
    Avoid unbounded s->uncompressed_block memory allocation by checking that
    the block_size header field has a reasonable value.  Also enforce the
    assumption that the value is a non-zero multiple of 512.
    
    These constraints conform to cloop 2.639's code so we accept existing
    image files.
