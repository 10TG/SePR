    vga: fix banked access bounds checking (CVE-2016-3710)
    
    vga allows banked access to video memory using the window at 0xa00000
    and it supports a different access modes with different address
    calculations.
    
    The VBE bochs extentions support banked access too, using the
    VBE_DISPI_INDEX_BANK register.  The code tries to take the different
    address calculations into account and applies different limits to
    VBE_DISPI_INDEX_BANK depending on the current access mode.
    
    Which is probably effective in stopping misprogramming by accident.
    But from a security point of view completely useless as an attacker
    can easily change access modes after setting the bank register.
    
    Drop the bogus check, add range checks to vga_mem_{readb,writeb}
    instead.
