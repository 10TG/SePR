    fuzz: refine the ide/ahci fuzzer configs
    
    Disks work differently depending on the x86 machine type (SATA vs PATA).
    Additionally, we should fuzz the atapi code paths, which might contain
    vulnerabilities such as CVE-2020-29443. This patch adds hard-disk and
    cdrom generic-fuzzer configs for both the pc (PATA) and q35 (SATA)
    machine types.
