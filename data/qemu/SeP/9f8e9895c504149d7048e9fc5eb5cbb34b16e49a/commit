    usb: sanity check setup_index+setup_len in post_load
    
    CVE-2013-4541
    
    s->setup_len and s->setup_index are fed into usb_packet_copy as
    size/offset into s->data_buf, it's possible for invalid state to exploit
    this to load arbitrary data.
    
    setup_len and setup_index should be checked to make sure
    they are not negative.
