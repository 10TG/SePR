    i386: Define the Virt SSBD MSR and handling of it (CVE-2018-3639)
    
    "Some AMD processors only support a non-architectural means of enabling
    speculative store bypass disable (SSBD).  To allow a simplified view of
    this to a guest, an architectural definition has been created through a new
    CPUID bit, 0x80000008_EBX[25], and a new MSR, 0xc001011f.  With this, a
    hypervisor can virtualize the existence of this definition and provide an
    architectural method for using SSBD to a guest.
    
    Add the new CPUID feature, the new MSR and update the existing SSBD
    support to use this MSR when present." (from x86/speculation: Add virtualized
    speculative store bypass disable support in Linux).
