    hw/pci/pcie_aer.c: fix buffer overruns on invalid state load
    
    4) CVE-2013-4529
    hw/pci/pcie_aer.c    pcie aer log can overrun the buffer if log_num is
                         too large
    
    There are two issues in this file:
    1. log_max from remote can be larger than on local
    then buffer will overrun with data coming from state file.
    2. log_num can be larger then we get data corruption
    again with an overflow but not adversary controlled.
    
    Fix both issues.
