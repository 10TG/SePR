    MAINTAINERS: addresses for responsible disclosure
    
    Adding addresses to MAINTAINERS, as agreed on the last conference call:
    
    http://wiki.qemu.org/SecurityProcess
    
    People sometimes detect security issues in upstream
    QEMU and don't know where to report them in a non-public way.
    Of course whoever just wants full disclosure can just go public,
    but there's nothing specified for non-public - until recently Anthony
    was doing this informally.
    
    As I started doing this recently anyway, I can handle this on the QEMU side
    in a more formal way.
    
    Adding a secalert mailing list as well - they are the ones who is actually
    opening CVEs, communicating issues to all downstreams etc,
    and they are already handling this for upstream, not just Red Hat.
    
    Keeping Anthony's address around in case he wants to be informed.
    
    Peter Maydell said that he prefers not to be on this contact list at
    this point.
    
    A public mailing list has been created - not listing it here yet -
    until we know how to set it up in a secure fashion and
    until there are more people so manually copying everyone
    becomes unwieldy for reporters.
