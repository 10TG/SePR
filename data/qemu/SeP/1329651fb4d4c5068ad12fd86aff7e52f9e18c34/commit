    qga: Restrict guest-file-read count to 48 MB to avoid crashes
    
    On [*] Daniel Berrangé commented:
    
      The QEMU guest agent protocol is not sensible way to access huge
      files inside the guest. It requires the inefficient process of
      reading the entire data into memory than duplicating it again in
      base64 format, and then copying it again in the JSON serializer /
      monitor code.
    
      For arbitrary general purpose file access, especially for large
      files, use a real file transfer program or use a network block
      device, not the QEMU guest agent.
    
    To avoid bug reports as BZ#1594054 (CVE-2018-12617), follow his
    suggestion to put a low, hard limit on "count" in the guest agent
    QAPI schema, and don't allow count to be larger than 48 MB.
