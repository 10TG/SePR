    qga: set umask 0077 when daemonizing (CVE-2013-2007)
    
    The qemu guest agent creates a bunch of files with insecure permissions
    when started in daemon mode. For example:
    
      -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root /var/log/qemu-ga.log
      -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root /var/run/qga.state
      -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root /var/log/qga-fsfreeze-hook.log
    
    In addition, at least all files created with the "guest-file-open" QMP
    command, and all files created with shell output redirection (or
    otherwise) by utilities invoked by the fsfreeze hook script are affected.
    
    For now mask all file mode bits for "group" and "others" in
    become_daemon().
    
    Temporarily, for compatibility reasons, stick with the 0666 file-mode in
    case of files newly created by the "guest-file-open" QMP call. Do so
    without changing the umask temporarily.
